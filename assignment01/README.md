Tentative Project Title: __Tuning Ultimate Guitar__

Project Description: My project consists of a usability analysis of the website Ultimate Guitar, which is used by music learners around the world to find the chords and tabs to the songs that they want to learn. With the heuristics evaluation, I propose where the website could be improved for middle-aged audiences who are just beginning to learn guitar. 

Website name: __Ultimate Guitar__

1. Visibility of system status (Severity rating: 2)

For Ultimate Guitar, their visibility of system status can be improved by changing the font/color of the section when the users click on it. For example, right now the website has multiple sections, including Tabs, Shots, and Courses, which the users can navigate around on the top of the home page. However, when these sections are selected and the users find themselves on these pages, there is no indicator of which page they are on. And if the user accidentally clicks on Shots, they might find it confusing as to what they are looking at and how to navigate back to the home page.

2. Match between system and the real world (Severity rating: 2)

As this second heuristic stresses the alignment between the real world and the targeted website, I find that some of the language used by Ultimate Guitar could be worked on a little bit more. For example, the section called Shots is quite misleading to users who are new to the website. While they can find out that the section contains many TikTok-like short videos posted by other music players, the name is not indicative enough. Therefore, it could be better to just change the name to Videos. What is more, right now the page is centered on one video while the others are pushed to the side – which, again, resembles TikTok. However, the users looking at the website on a computer might not find it intuitive to see a phone layout on a big screen, so the web designers might want to think about how to best combine short videos and the computer screen. 

3. User control and freedom (Severity rating: 1)

When on the Tabs page, the user can find some filters on the left side of the screen. These filters include the difficulty level of the songs, as well as genre, decade, and style. By clicking on these filters, the users can find a new list of songs selected based on their criteria. Here, it is nice that each selected filter is highlighted and has a delete mark added next to it, telling the users that they can delete the filter and go back to the original setting. This gives the user freedom of control as they can test around to see what music they can find based on different filters.

4. UX consistency and standards (Severity rating: 2)

One thing that might be minor but that I find is less consistent is the design of each section. Ultimate Guitar is very text-based – its home page is mostly text with few images. However, in the section named Courses, the page is suddenly filled with colorful images for the user to navigate around. This inconsistency seems to suggest that these pages are designed at different times and by different people. It could be better, then, if Ultimate Guitar sticks to a design that uses some amount of images on each web page. 

5. Error prevention (Severity rating: 2)

One thing that I noticed on the Shots page is that the video starts playing automatically when you are on the page. However, it is also automatically muted and there would be a pop-up blue box that tells you where to turn on the sound. This, in my opinion, is wonderful error prevention because it prevents the embarrassment of the user when they accidentally navigate to this page and music starts playing out loud. Also, when the users accidentally favorite a tab, they can immediately un-favorite it by clicking on the same heart button, and there would be a text box on the bottom left of the page saying that the tab has been removed from the favorite list. 

6. Recognition vs. Recall (Severity rating: 1)

One problem I noticed regarding this heuristic is the message centerr. The bell icon on the top right suggests that it is related to notifications. However, the text next to it when there is no new notification says "No new." The user could guess that it means no new messages, but the incompleteness of the text makes it less intuitive and more "recall."

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use (Severity rating: 2)

For the most part, Ultimate Guitar is situated in the already well-established web conventions, in that the users can go back to the last page using the browser's go-back button. As well, the Ultimate Guitar icon on the top right corner of the page is clickable and clicking on it brings the user back to the home page of the web. One thing that I found a little bit different but quite useful on the website is that when logged in, there is always the personal section available to the right side of the screen. This means that the user can easily go back to their own playlists with a single click. 

8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design (Severity rating: 3)

Ultimate Guitar's website could be said to be simple in the way that it is mostly text-based. However, it is not so much on the aesthetic side – the page is centered around 4 colors: black, white, yellow, and red, while the chords and tabs pages are mostly white with black texts. I believe that the website could be made more aesthetically pleasing and consistent if the chords pages match the web design palette. The formatting of the home page can also be better improved, as now it is crammed information from different sections of the website. Instead of showing everything at once, the website could have a more simplistic home page so that users can see its essence and function more easily, like reading the thesis to a paper.

9. Help users with errors (Severity rating: 2)

On the bottom of the website, there are multiple features that can be accessed. For example, there is a Suggest a feature button, which allows the website to adapt to user's needs. The Support section helps with troubleshooting, such as forgetting passwords and setting a new profile picture. If the users want, they can also find information on how to read tabs from Guitar Pro. However, the page will have to be redirected and the whole process seems quite long and unnecessary. 

10. Help and documentation (Severity rating: 1)

On the bottom of the page, there is also About and Site rules, but it is less indicative where the users can find a guide to navigate the website, which makes it less beginner-friendly. Truthfully, it seems that Ultimate Guitar has been used by people for a long time and any major change to the website may upset its long-time users. If that is the case, then a comprehensive guide to the website becomes more necessary. 

Second Website name: __Songsterr__

1. Visibility of system status (Severity rating: 1)

From the website, the users can see pretty clearly what page they are on. As the website is focused on tabs, the web page is mostly occupied by the actual tabs of the songs. On the right side of the page, there is a list of different icons. One of these icons allows the user to select which track that they want to play in the song, like distortion, clean, bass, etc. This, however, is not clear enough from the icon itself, especially among the different tracks of guitar. There is a text indicator though under the namme of the song, but it might be able to be better indicated so that the text is connected to the icon and the users can see clearly how to swtich tracks.


2. Match between system and the real world (Severity rating: 1)

As mentioned before, the site has intuitive symbols which can be easily understood by contemporary computer users. The tabs also have complete information about the song in terms of tempo, lyrics, and chords, which makes it very readable to people who know how to read tabs. The play function of these tabs also means that the user can listen to the song to better understand its rhythm. 

3. User control and freedom (Severity rating: 1)

The user has a lot of control on the website as to how they want to play the song. However, the filter system is not as sophisticated compared to Ultimate Guitar because the users can't filter by genre and decade. It really means that the users need to have specific songs in mind or else they can only choose songs according to difficulty. 

4. UX consistency and standards (Severity rating: 0)

There isn't really much to critique about the UX consistency of the website as the design as well as icons are used consistently. The fact that each section is a pop up page from the left makes makes it easy for the user to navigate back to the page that they want – even if they accidentally click on something wrong, they wouldn't have to worry about not recognizing the page.

5. Error prevention (Severity rating: 1)

Error prevention on Songsterr is only problematic if the user finds themselves on the wrong track and don't know how to switch to another track. I think that a better way to approach this is by highlighting the track part with a pop-up text box so that the user knows where to switch. 

6.  Recognition vs. Recall (Severity rating: 2)

When I first started using this website, I found that the list of symbols on the right are a little bit difficult to understand. They do have alt texts that appear when you hover over them but these alt-texts appear rather slowly, so sometimes you can only figure out what the button does by clicking on it, which is less intuitive. I think, in this case, the alt-text could be a more built-in function of the web page so that it immediately pops up when the cursor hovers on it.

7.  Flexibility and efficiency of use (Severity rating: 1)

Like mentioned before, the website is easy to navigate around and the users don't have to worry about losing the main page. What I think could be better on this website is to mark the functions that are available only to members. For example, the speed function can only be used by people who have Songsterr plus, and the users can only find out about it tby clicking on the button. It could be better if the buttons that are in the Plus membership are shown in other colors or in a different section.

8. Aesthetic and minimalistic design (Severity rating: 1)

The design of the web really coheres to what we regard as minimalist and aesthetic. Songsterr has a much more modern design compared to Ultimate guitar in that it shows a bright and simple surface. However, the About page and the Terms of Use page are placed at the bottom of the tabs page, so depending on the length of the tabs, the users would spend different time trying to find them and may not even know that they exist. It might be better if this part shows up as a banner that stays at the bottom of the screen wherever the user scrolls.

9. Help users with errors (Severity rating: 1)

On the left of the screen, there is a section called Questions? which includes many popular questions about the website. This is very helpful and easy to find so that users can easily know how to tackle their errors. 

10. Help and documentation (Severity rating: 1)

Similar to Ultimate guitar, there is a blog section on Songsterr, but it is separate from the main tabs page. This means that if the user want to learn more about guitar from other players, there is still a community on Songsterr. However, as the page is separate, they might find it difficult to navigate between different pages. Here, it seems that the comment section of Ultimate Guitar makes it seems more like a community.
